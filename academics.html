                    <h4>My Name Is Asher Lev</h4>
                    <span class="author">by Chaim Potok</span>
                    <p> A brilliant novel. The short and fragmented sentences, like the short and powerful strokes of an
                        impressionist painting, cloaked this novel with a tranquil, almost stream-of-consciousness
                        quality,
                        which made the characters and the story feel especially real and alive. Under the fluid
                        narrative
                        swelled the rich warmth of family, and a profound message of art and religion rose from this
                        simple
                        yet moving story.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</h4>
                    <span class="author">by Victor Hugo</span>
                    <p>Five stars to this timeless tragedy of external against internal forms of beauty and selfish
                        against
                        selfless acts of love, with an intense romance no less powerful or destructive than that in
                        Wuthering
                        Heights, and characters no less monstrous yet humane than those in Frankenstein.
                        <br> Although I was bored by some historical and slow-paced chapters, and the archetypes are
                        glaringly
                        extreme in this novel, Victor Hugo successfully kept me on the edge of the chair through this
                        exhilarating
                        emotional ride, and the dramatic irony held me in so firm a grasp unrivaled by even Shakespeare.
                        The descriptions are so skillfully written that I can still recall scenes in this book as images
                        in my head, like that of a movie; but unlike a movie, the words are infinitely more powerful and
                        the imagination that they inspire are infinitely more unforgettable. </p>

                    <h4>All the Light We Cannot See</h4>
                    <span class="author">by Anthony Doerr</span>
                    <p> I may not comprehend the subtlety of Dickens' diction, I may not appreciate the beauty of Mary
                        Shelly's
                        prose, and I may not enjoy the greatness that Jane Austin's simple story encapsulates; but I was
                        completely blown away by the hauntingly beautiful writing of this touching story.
                        <br>It is about the courage of the blind girl against the evil of the war that tears her family
                        asunder,
                        and it is about the innocence of the orphan boy against the cruelty of reality that extinguishes
                        the spark of his curiosity; it is something excruciatingly beautiful, and it is something
                        stunningly
                        heartbreaking; and it is a story that digs up all the light we cannot see under the atrocities
                        of
                        the war and the indifference of history. </p>

                    <h4>David Copperfield</h4>
                    <span class="author">by Charles Dickens</span>
                    <p> I’ve only finished this book yesterday. Oh, how happy and sad I was! How could I not be infected
                        by the celestial happiness of the blissful ending, and how could I not be sad to finally
                        separate
                        with those so dear and unique companions! Tears of happiness swelled in my eyes when I traversed
                        between the lines of Agnes and David’s confession, and how empty I felt, when I had to
                        reluctantly
                        let go of this world, as the last paragraph came to a quiet and serene end! No more need I
                        praise
                        the witty prose and masterful storytelling of my favorite author, and no more need I exclaim the
                        realness of the characters and the details of the world; for I don’t wish to complacently
                        comment
                        on this great novel, nor associate my vain and childish words with one of the most venerated
                        author
                        and greatest work in the history - I just want to throw my entirety into this world, and never,
                        ever
                        leave. </p>

                    <h4>Les Misérables</h4>
                    <span class="author">by Victor Hugo</span>
                    <p> I love the enthralling story and Hugo's acute yet poetic autopsy of the society, but I have to
                        admit
                        that I have neither the patience nor the passion to appreciate the history sections in this
                        book,
                        and I actually skipped a few of them. Nonetheless it was very hard to finally put down this
                        tome,
                        with love and humanity so overwhelming and poverty and degradation so heartbreaking and all
                        aspects
                        of the society, from the basest street urchin to the noblest philanthropist, treated with love
                        and
                        care so sincere and touching that a sense of progress and belief in humanity arises even from
                        the
                        most miserable of the society and the bloodiest of the revolution. </p>

                    <h4>Oliver Twist</h4>
                    <span class="author">by Charles Dickens</span>
                    <p> Bravo… Dickens mercilessly tore apart the hypocrisy of the Poor Law and the Puritan Church by
                        his
                        witty sarcasm, and his fastidious portrayal of the sordid and immoral society during the
                        Industrial
                        Revolution showed the degradation of humanity that is appalling to even imagine. The story,
                        although
                        filled with clearly identifiable Victorian archetypes, was very intriguing and memorable; and
                        when
                        Nancy was brutally murdered, I wanted to cry, but being tired, I was only left with an ineffable
                        anguish and a gratification for being able to live in our contemporary world. </p>

                    <h4>Great Expectations</h4>
                    <span class="author">by Charles Dickens</span>
                    <p> Never have I met characters so lively and memorable, as those sculpted by Dickens in this novel.
                        When I was first introduced to the ghastly house occupied by the eccentric Miss Havisham, for a
                        second
                        I thought I was in a science fiction novel; but I couldn't be more wrong, as the characters
                        developed
                        so completely and the story was concluded so beautifully, that it completely surpassed my
                        already
                        great expectations for this book.
                        <br>Thank you, Dickens, for again reminding me of the power that a novel can truly possess. </p>
